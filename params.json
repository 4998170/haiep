{"name":"Haiep","body":"### Welcome to Haiep Pages.\r\nHaiep got its name by acronymed of HBase Automatic Import and Export Processing(HAIEP), which aims to metadata management and data migration between HBase and RDBMS, unlike Sqoop http://sqoop.apache.org/, which provide transferring bulk data between Apache Hadoop and structured datastores such as relational databases using MapReduce jobs, our implementation only relies on basic HBase Java API. Built on java multithreading technology, Haiep exceeds Sqoop when operating on small data migration, since it doesn't have to startup Hadoop jobs(which is always a time-consuming process) and thus can benefit from lightweight launch.\r\n\r\n### Documentation\r\nComing soon.\r\n\r\n### You've Found a bug or want the author provide more features?\r\nReport to the author @forhappy.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@forhappy\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nhaipingf@gmail.com OR\r\nhaiping.ict@gmail.com","tagline":"HBase automatic import and export processing","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
